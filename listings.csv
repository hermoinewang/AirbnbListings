While we adore international adventures, we also regularly road trip throughout the beautiful west.  Our most recent notable adventure as a family of 4 was to Miami, St Lucia and Dominica - our timing was incredible, as we landed back in the US *just* as news of the pandemic was heating up.  Sans kiddos we've enjoyed Paris, Brazil, South Africa, and we're eyeing New Zealand next.  We have a 6 year old, plus an toddler, and enjoy exploring the world through their eyes.

Our interests include cooking/dining, nature, travel, animals, wine, hiking, and we're big fans of the tv shows Curb Your Enthusiasm, Chef's Table, and Top Chef.

We moved to the Monterey Peninsula from Portland Oregon in the fall of '09 and haven't looked back.  (Okay, we admit, we REALLY miss the interesting assortment of people, and the incredible restaurants + fabulous food carts!)

We are passionate about the environment and do what we can to run a ""green"" household such as: recycle and compost, serve food that is organic and local, use only earth friendly cleaning/household products, etc.

Hosts since 2010, we truly enjoy meeting new people, and welcoming all of our fantastic regulars, many of which feel more like friends, at this point.

We also spend a lot of time hiking around Big Sur and Carmel Valley. 
Being an Airbnb host is a perfect fit for me because I truly, genuinely full heartedly (you get the point) want guests to have a magical stay while they're here.

We eloped in Central Park in New York City and love the simplicity of what life brings.  We enjoy exploring new things.  Whether it’s new foods, places to visit or experiences, we love the adventure of life.  Most of all, we love time with each other, our kids, family and friends.  

We were lucky enough to purchase the home of John Steinbeck, American author and Pulitzer Prize winner, and have poured our labor of love in renovating these 100 year-old cottages.  Pacific Grove is our home away from home.  Kevin spent a lot of time writing his first book, A Life Worth Living, in our cottages - what a fantastic place for literary inspiration!

When Steinbeck resided here he formulated the plot of The Grapes of Wrath, and wrote several books including The Sea of Cortez.  This is the home he shared with his second wife, Gwyn Conger, who would become the inspiration for the lead antagonist, Kate Trask, in his epic novel, East of Eden.  In a letter to a friend, Steinbeck wrote of the cottages, “It is a pleasant little house, and we miss it… You’ll find you get a lot of thinking done in that house.” ' (from John Steinbeck, A Life in Letters).

Little did I know these mentors would prepare me for my Vacation Rental venture this year.

I've also discovered my inner gift for interior decorating.  Casa Amarilla has been a labor-of-love restoring and modernizing this quaint Monterey Cottage...a stone throw from the Aquarium.

My green thumb came back to life as well.  The patio and fenced garden area has blossomed this spring, and soothes one's sole at the end of an active day.  A wood burning pot belly fire-pit and charcoal BBQ enhance this spacious artistic zen-like garden, while taking in the distant Monterey Bay view...our guests favorite!

While staying at Casa Amarilla, don't hesitate to call or text me if you and your group need anything at all!

PRIVACY. I enjoy meeting people and hearing their stories, but I also appreciate their need for privacy. Should we pass each other during the course of your stay, feel free to ask a question, chat, or just wave hello.

COMFORT. The rooms are bright and human-scaled, the furniture is wood, the kitchen is modern, and the appliances are well-maintained. The locks, light switches, thermostat, faucets, and fixtures are simple and reliable. You'll find only tasteful, simple comfort, without smart devices, personal effects, or other clutter.

COMPLIANCE. I hold Short-Term Rental (STR) License 0452 from the City of Pacific Grove, meaning my rental complies with municipal code and has been inspected for safety and cleanliness by a city inspector and a licensed contractor.

In early 2017, I joined Airbnb as a host and managed my first Airbnb property. Ever since then, I have never stopped creating more and more unique homes for my Airbnb guests. Up to this point, we are offering more than 13 properties in the Bay Area and California Coastal area. Each property has its unique interior design and furniture layout. But my goal for each property is to provide the most comfortable stays and amazing experience for all of my guests.  

When I travel, I always stay at Airbnb properties. I personally have very high expectations when staying away from home and I hope all my properties meet yours, knowing you are traveling away from your home. My team members include my partner, Carrie, a customer service crew, a cleaning crew and a repair / handyman crew. They are on call 7-days a week at your service. We strive to exceed expectations to all of our guests with the utmost respect and respond. We will ensure each property is thoroughly cleaned with enhanced cleaning protocols, and with fresh bed sheets, towels, and bath rugs upon your arrival. 

I hand picked all of the furniture, bed sheets and kitchen equipment for each of our properties. I want to make sure everything my guests use is high quality with a unique style to allow them fully enjoy the space, because my guests deserve the best!

I am also an active member of Airbnb.org which is a non-profit organization started by the founders of Airbnb. In a daily basis, I donate a certain percentage of my revenue from each guest's booking to Airbnb.org. Our mission is to unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of needs! We partner with the worldwide communities to open housing in emergencies in order to  provide shelters for people who lost their homes. 

Thank you! My team and I look forward to hosting you in the near future!
